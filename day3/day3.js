// Interaction with system
// There are two methods by which we can interact with the system/machine/computer:

// GUI ⇒ Graphical User Interface

// This is the pretty common way that we use to interact with the system,
// that includes taking the help of graphics to demonstrate and visualise
// all the actions that we are doing.

// CLI ⇒ Command Line Interface

// This kind of interaction mainly involves writing specific commands to
// perform any kind of operation in the system.


// Basic Windows CLI Commands

// Package.json is a file in the root directory of a Node.js 
// project that holds various information relevant to the project. 
// This file gives information to npm that allows it to identify the project
//  as well as handle the project’s dependencies.
// A package.json file:
// lists the packages your project is dependent on
// specifies versions of a package that your project can use/ using
// makes your build reproducible, and therefore easier to share with other developers
// contains other metadata such as a project description, the version of the project
//  in a particular distribution, license information, even configuration data etc
// is vital to both npm and the end-users of the package
